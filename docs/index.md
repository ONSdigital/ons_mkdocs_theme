# ONS MkDocs Theme

This is an Office for National Statistics (ONS) branded theme that can be used in conjunction with MkDocs.

The purpose of this theme is to give users a way of generating styled documentation.

This theme leans heavily on the Material for MkDocs that was created by Martin Donath. His original files can be accessed [here](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).
